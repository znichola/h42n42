# h42n42

Simulate the life of a population of creatures threatened by a terrifying virus.

Also, OCaml in the browser!

> A project introducing the OCSIGEN framework, used to create rich applications in OCaml. The goal is to design a simulator of bugs escaping a dangerous virus.


## OCaml commands

```bash
opam exec -- dune build
opam exec -- dune exec h42n42

# watch mode
opam exec -- dune exec h42n42 -w

# launch utop, interactive shell
opam exec -- dune utop

# install a package, in this case a s-expression printer
opam install sexplib
```

## Eliom comands

See [README_ELIOM.md](/README_ELIOM.md) for mroe details.

```bash
# Build the website
make all

# Put website files in local/var/www/h42n42
make install

# Start the server
make run

# Build and run the server
make test.byte
```

## Thoughts

Untangling this OCaml shaped mess.

The OCSIGEN framework is some big group of modules, Eliom is also a fullstack framework? Not sure that the diff is, but Eliom docs tutorials align more with what the subject wants.

## Installing OCaml on school computers

```

Run bash line to download opam to a folder in sgoinfre, put this in `PATH` by modifying the `.zshrc`.

```zsh
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
```

Then init opam by telling it where the root should be so it's got the space to install.

```zsh
opam init --root="~/sgoinfre/.opam"
```

Add this line to `.zshrc` to tell opam where it's root is.

```zshrc
export OPAMROOT=/sgoinfre/znichola/.opam
```


### Runing in Docker

```zsh
docker run -v .:/home/opam/app -w /home/opam/app  -it --rm ocaml/opam:debian
```
